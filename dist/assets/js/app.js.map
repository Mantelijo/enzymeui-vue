This way whenever checkbox is checked, it's value of\r\n checkbox-value attribute will be added to bound array. For example:\r\n\r\n <Checkbox v-model=\"checkboxes\" checkbox-value=\"first\">Simple checkbox</Checkbox>\r\n <Checkbox v-model=\"checkboxes\" checkbox-value=\"second\">Simple checked checkbox</Checkbox>\r\n <Checkbox v-model=\"checkboxes\" checkbox-value=\"third\" >Simple unchecked checkbox</Checkbox>\r\n Assuming that checkboxes is array, if we check all checkboxes, then the array would look like this:\r\n [first, second, third].\r\n We can also use bounded array to control which checkbox should be checked by populating the checkboxes array\r\n with corresponding checkbox-value values.\r\n When using this method it is recommended to use checkbox-value props, otherwise there might be unexpected results\r\n\r\n 2: Using v-model with separate variables or object and components. Create separate variable/object property which controls each component.\r\n Lets assume that we have this setup:\r\n checkboxes = {\r\n        first:false,\r\n        second:false,\r\n    }\r\n <Checkbox v-model=\"checkboxes.first\" >Simple checkbox</Checkbox>\r\n <Checkbox v-model=\"checkboxes.second\" >Simple checked checkbox</Checkbox>\r\n Then checkboxes object would be updated with boolean values when we interact with Checkbox component.\r\n\r\n Properties: see description of props objects\r\n */\r\n\r\nimport {generateKey} from \"../../helpers/helpers\";\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n    name: \"Checkbox\",\r\n\r\n    props: {\r\n        label: {\r\n            type: String,\r\n            default: '',\r\n            required: false,\r\n            description: 'Label for checkbox',\r\n        },\r\n        value: {\r\n            type: Boolean | String,\r\n            default: false,\r\n            required: false,\r\n            description: 'Is checkbox checked.
