EnzymeUI uses `vue-cli` therefore usual `npm` workflow scripts are available

#### Usage
- `npm run serve` - to build and serve development application
- `npm run build` - to build production bundle 
- **Don't forget to configure your `publicPath` in `vue.config.js` for static assets when using `vue-cli` generated `index.html` file**
- If you want to include this into existing project or framework and not develop standalone single page application: 
make sure to include files from `/dist/js` and `/dist/css` correctly into your project

Check out `vue.config.js` file for more configuration options
